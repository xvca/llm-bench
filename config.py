Everything from listing an empty lot as an address, to voting in both a D & R primary, to being a felon or non-citizen and voting. More than anything, it reveals that the system seems to be working, as even small scale infractions get caught and punished. Ironically, the most notorious, widespread and coordinated actual voter fraud of recent memory, which involved a Republican consultant committing large scale fraud over multiple cycles and involving many people, is not on the list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCrae_Dowless, https://www.salon.com/2019/07/31/gop-operative-indicted-for-n-c-election-fraud-now-charged-with-ballot-rigging-in-another-race/`""",
